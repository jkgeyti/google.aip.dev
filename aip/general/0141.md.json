When appropriate, units\n**should** use generally accepted abbreviations (for example, `distance_km`\nrather than `distance_kilometers`).\n\n```proto\n// A representation of a non-stop air route.\nmessage Route {\n  // The airport where the route begins.\n  string origin = 1;\n\n  // The destination airport.\n  string destination = 2;\n\n  // The distance between the origin and destination airports.\n  // This value is also used to determine the credited frequent flyer miles.\n  int32 distance_miles = 3;\n}\n```\n\nIf the quantity is a number of items (for example, the number of nodes in a\ncluster), then the field **should** use the suffix `_count` (**not** the prefix\n`num_`):\n\n```proto\n// A cluster of individual nodes.\nmessage Cluster {\n  // The number of nodes in the cluster.\n  int32 node_count = 1;\n}\n```\n\n**Note:** Fields **must not** use unsigned integer types, because many\nprogramming languages and systems do not support them well.\n\n### Specialized messages\n\nIt is sometimes useful to create a message that represents a particular\nquantity. This is particularly valuable in two situations:\n\n- Grouping two or more individual quantities together. Example:\n  [`google.protobuf.Duration`][duration]\n- Representing a common concept where the unit of measurement may itself vary.\n  Example: [`google.type.Money`][money]\n\nAPIs **may** create messages to represent quantities when appropriate. When\nusing these messages as fields, APIs **should** use the name of the message as\nthe suffix for the field name if it makes intuitive sense to do so.\n\n## Changelog\n\n- **2019-09-13**: Added the prohibition on uint and fixed types.\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->\n[duration]: https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/master/src/google/protobuf/duration.proto\n[money]: https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/type/money.proto\n<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->\n"}
