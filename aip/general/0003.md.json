Example: `v2023-03-28`.\n- The AIPs **must** have a new version when there is a significant change to one\n  or more AIPs.\n- Each AIP **must** include a changelog section, with the date the change was\n  made and a short description.\n\n## Rationale\n\nVersions serve as reference points to AIPs at a specific point in time. They are\ncrucial since guidance on an AIP can be reversed, or include significant changes\nsuch that they are no longer similar to the original design. APIs using AIPs may\nneed to reference older AIP guidance to justify their design choice.\n\n### Rationale for date-based versioning\n\nWith date-based versioning, a client can easily find the AIP guidance at the\ntime an API was authored.\n\n### Why not individually versioned AIPs\n\nAn alternative to a universal version is to have specific versions attached to\neach AIP.\n\nAIPs often cross-reference one another. If each AIP had a specific version, then\ncross-references would also have to specify specific versions of those\nreferenced AIPs to provide complete guidance."}
