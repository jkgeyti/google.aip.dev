{"text":"---\nid: 143\nstate: approved\ncreated: 2019-07-24\nplacement:\n  category: fields\n  order: 40\n---\n\n# Standardized codes\n\nMany common concepts, such as spoken languages, countries, currency, and so on,\nhave common codes (usually formalized by the [International Organization for\nStandardization][iso]) that are used in data communication and processing.\nThese codes address the issue that there are often different ways to express\nthe same concept in written language (for example, \"United States\" and \"USA\",\nor \"Espa√±ol\" and \"Spanish\").\n\n## Guidance\n\nFor concepts where a standardized code exists and is in common use, fields\nrepresenting these concepts **should** use the standardized code for both input\nand output.\n\n```proto\n// A message representing a book.\nmessage Book {\n  // Other fields...\n\n  // The IETF BCP-47 language code representing the language in which\n  // the book was originally written.\n  // https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag\n  string language_code = 99;\n}\n```\n\n- Fields representing standardized concepts **must** use the appropriate data\n  type for the standard code (usually `string`).\n  - Fields representing standardized concepts **should not** use enums, even if\n    they only allow a small subset of possible values. Using enums in this\n    situation often leads to frustrating lookup tables when using multiple APIs\n    together.\n  - Fields representing standardized concepts **must** indicate which standard\n    they follow, preferably with a link (either to the standard itself, the\n    Wikipedia description, or something similar).\n- The field name **should** end in `_code` or `_type` unless the concept has an\n  obviously clearer suffix.\n- When accepting values provided by users, validation **should** be\n  case-insensitive unless this would introduce ambiguity (for example, accept\n  both `en-gb` and `en-GB`). When providing values to users, APIs **should**\n  use the canonical case (in the example above, `en-GB`).\n\n### Content types\n\nFields representing a content or media type **must** use [IANA media types][].\nFor legacy reasons, the field **should** be called `mime_type`.\n\n### Countries and regions\n\nFields representing individual countries or nations **must** use the [Unicode\nCLDR region codes][cldr] ([list][]), such as `US` or `CH`, and the field\n**must** be called `region_code`.\n\n**Important:** We use `region_code` and not `country_code` to include regions\ndistinct from any country, and avoid political disputes over whether or not\nsome regions are countries.\n\n### Currency\n\nFields representing currency **must** use [ISO-4217 currency codes][iso-4217],\nsuch as `USD` or `CHF`, and the field **must** be called `currency_code`.\n\n**Note:** For representing an amount of money in a particular currency, rather\nthan the currency code itself, use [`google.protobuf.Money`][money].\n\n### Language\n\nFields representing spoken languages **must** use [IETF BCP-47 language\ncodes][bcp-47] ([list][]), such as `en-US` or `de-CH`, and the field **must**\nbe called `language_code`.\n\n### Time zones\n\nFields representing a time zone **should** use the [IANA TZ][] codes, and the\nfield **must** be called `time_zone`.\n\nFields also **may** represent a UTC offset rather than a time zone (note that\nthese are subtly different). In this case, the field **must** use the [ISO-8601\nformat][] to represent this, and the field **must** be named `utc_offset`.\n\n## Changelog\n\n- **2020-05-12**: Replaced `country_code` guidance with `region_code`,\n  correcting an original error.\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->\n[bcp-47]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag\n[cldr]: http://cldr.unicode.org/\n[iana media types]: https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml\n[iana tz]: http://www.iana.org/time-zones\n[iso]: https://www.iso.org/\n[iso-4217]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217\n[iso-8601 format]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Time_offsets_from_UTC\n[list]: https://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry\n[money]: https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/type/money.proto\n<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->\n"}
