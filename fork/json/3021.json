In some cases, there are common components for representing these\ntypes.\n\n## Guidance\n\nFulfillment APIs **must** use the Actions on Google common types when\napplicable, and **must not** use alternative type protos. For example, an API\nwhich needs to represent a monetary amount **must** use\n[google.type.Money][money], and **must not** use an alternative representation.\n\nAPIs **may** wrap existing types in new protos. This may be useful in order to\ndefine compound types, provide additional metadata, provide semantic signals\n(if the typed value was obtained from a user query), etc.\n\n## Actions on Google common types\n\nThe Actions on Google common types include all the protobuf types and API types\ndefined in [AIP-213][], as well as all the protos in\n[google.actions.type.\\*][actions-type].\n\n### Adding new types\n\nIf a given API needs a type for which there is no existing common type, and the\ntype is not conceptually specific to that API, and the type is well understood\nenough to be modeled in a permanent/unversioned way, then API author **should**\nconsider proposing a new Actions on Google common type in\n[google.actions.type.\\*][actions-type].\n\nThe guidance in [AIP-213][] also applies to creating new\nActions on Google common types. Specifically, API authors proposing new types\n**should** consider whether a new type should be a Google-wide common type\nrather than an Actions on Google common type. One exception to this is that new\nActions on Google common types are not proposed by opening a GitHub ticket.\nInstead, Actions on Google API authors who want to create a new type should\nemail the owners of the //google/actions/type directory directly.\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->\n[aip-213]: ../0213.md\n[date]: https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/tree/master/google/type/date.proto\n[timeofday]: https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/tree/master/google/type/timeofday.proto\n[duration]: https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/tree/master/src/google/protobuf/duration.proto\n[money]: https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/tree/master/google/type/money.proto\n[postaladdress]: https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/tree/master/google/type/postal_address.proto\n[type]: https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/tree/master/google/type/\n[actions-type]: https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/tree/master/google/actions/type/\n<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->\n"}
