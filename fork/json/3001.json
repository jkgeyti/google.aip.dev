Any\ndetails of [AIP-1][] not modified or contradicted by this AIP also apply to\nActions on Google AIPs.\n\n## Stakeholders\n\nAs with any process there are many different stakeholders when it comes to\nreviewing and working with AIPs. Below is a summary of the escalation path\nstarting with the API producer.\n\n```graphviz\ndigraph d_front_back {\n  rankdir=BT;\n  ranksep=0.3;\n  node [ style=\"filled,solid\" shape=box fontname=\"Roboto\" ];\n\n  producer [ label=\"API Producer\" ];\n  editors [ label=\"AIP Editors\" ];\n  aog_editors [ label=\"Actions on Google AIP Editors\" ];\n  tl_infra [ label=\"Infrastructure TL\" ];\n  tl_design [ label=\"Design TL\" ];\n  tl [ label=\"TL\" ];\n\n  producer -> aog_editors;\n  aog_editors -> editors;\n  editors -> tl_infra -> tl;\n  editors -> tl_design -> tl;\n}\n```\n\n### Actions on Google Editors\n\nThe Actions on Google editors are the set of people who make decisions on\nActions on Google AIPs before escalation to the general editors defined in\n[AIP-1][].\n\nThe list of Actions on Google AIP editors is currently:\n\n- Ali Ibrahim ([@ahahibrahim][])\n- Richard Frankel ([@rofrankel][])\n- Shuyang Chen ([@Canain][])\n\nThe Actions on Google editors have the same responsibilities as the general\neditors. They also have the additional responsibility of establishing\ncorrectness of, and leadership support for, the contents of Actions on Google\nAIPs.\n\nActions on Google AIP editorship is by invitation of the current Actions on\nGoogle editors.\n\n[aip-1]: ../0001.md\n[@ahahibrahim]: https://github.com/ahahibrahim\n[@rofrankel]: https://github.com/rofrankel\n[@canain]: https://github.com/Canain\n"}
