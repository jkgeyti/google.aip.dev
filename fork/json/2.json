Importantly, _all_ AIPs\nhave numbers, not just approved ones. The [AIP Index](/) clearly delineates\nwhich AIPs are approved and binding and which are under discussion.\n\nThe editors may decide to reserve a specific block of numbers for groups of\nAIPs that are related in some way (for example, that are only scoped to a\nspecific subset of APIs).\n\nBeyond this, AIP numbers are assigned arbitrarily. In general, the editors will\ntake the next AIP number off of the stack to assign to a draft AIP, but\noccasionally may use a special/joke number if useful for mnemonic or other\nreasons.\n\n## AIP Blocks\n\nCurrently recognized blocks of AIP numbers are:\n\n### Generally Applicable\n\n- **1-99:** Reserved for meta-AIPs (generally process-related).\n- **100-999:** General API design guidance\n\n### Google Product Areas\n\n- **2700-2799:** Apps (Google Workspace)\n- **2500-2599:** Cloud\n- **3000-3099:** Actions on Google\n- **3200-3299:** Firebase\n- **4100-4199:** Auth libraries\n- **4200-4299:** Client libraries\n- **4600-4699:** Geo\n\nTo request a block for a specific team that is publishing API guidance or\ndocumentation germane to that specific team, reach out to api-editors@.\n\n## Changelog\n\n- **2019-10-03:** The 3000-3099 block was assigned to Actions on Google.\n- **2019-01-26:** The general API design guidance block was expanded to include\n  100-199.\n- **2018-10-24:** The 4600-4699 block was assigned to Google Geo.\n- **2018-10-02:** The 2500-2599 block was assigned to Google Cloud Platform.\n- **2018-10-02:** The 2700-2799 block was assigned to Google Workspace.\n"}
