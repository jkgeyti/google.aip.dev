{"text": "---\nid: 2716\nstate: approved\ncreated: 2018-09-10\n---\n\n# Standard terms in names\n\nAPIs have a lot of identifier names (fields, constants, methods, ...), that\noften contain terms for things, such as `url` (`getUrl()`, `doc_url`, ...) or\n`id` (`lookupId()`, `student_id`).\n\nIt is useful to have a standard set of terms for common concepts in these\nvarious names. This makes it easier for developers to understand new APIs based\non previous experience. It is not (for example) that `id` is a better term than\n`uid` or other options, but it also is not worse, and having different choices\nin different APIs is confusing and unnecessary.\n\nThis AIP defines terms to use for such common concepts. These terms should be\nused for the same concept in identifier names.\n\nThis is supplemental to the API design guide, which lists [standard field\nnames][] and has other rules about identifiers.\n\n[standard field names]: https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/standard_fields\n\n## Guidance\n\nAbsent other, more specific guidance, APIs **should** use the following\nstandard terms (as opposed to alternatives) as parts of identifier names to\nrefer to common concepts, and **must not** use them to refer to other things:\n\n- `uri` for URIs/URLs (as opposed to `url`, `link`, `href`, etc.)\n- `id` for a unique identifier, either globally unique or within a specified\n  context\n- `index` to indicate an ordinal number of an item within a collection, such as\n  `message_index` on a message to say what place it occupies in a stream of\n  message (unless there is a more specific name to use, such as if the number\n  also is used as an ID, use `id`).\n\nAPIs **should** avoid use of the term `resource` in fields that have resource\nnames, as this is redundant.\n\nAny more specific guidance overrides these rules. For example, the [AIP-122][]\nrule to use `name` for the resource name overrides using the term `id` for\nunique identifiers.\n\n[aip-122]: ../0122.md\n\n## Fallback to schema.org\n\nIf you are looking for standard terms for things, [schema.org][] is a good\nplace to look for terms that have been fairly widely vetted as being normal,\ncustomary, and/or clear. You **should** consult it when choosing identifier\nnames when other strategies fail.\n\n[schema.org]: https://schema.org/\n"}
