When they can not, this is surprising and\ndisappointing. Historically, Google Workspace has not insisted on this kind of\ncompleteness. However, we want to move towards that goal, hence this\nrequirement for a plan, while we only advise completeness itself.\n\nFor major changes, however, the desire for completeness will be amplified.\n\n## Guidance\n\nEach action that can be performed in the UI **should** be possible to do via a\npublic API. For example, if there is a button in the UI to add a widget, there\n**should** be some way to add a widget using the API. This simplifies the\nuser's understanding of the API, and makes it easier to record UI actions to be\nreplayed via the API.\n\nThe question of _when_ the completeness ought to be achieved is not fixed. Each\nteam **must** have a plan for API completeness, even if it is a simple\nstatement, such as, \"When we are given resources to do so.\" (We would prefer\nmore, but if that is your plan, then so be it.)\n"}
