A batch create method provides this functionality.\n\n## Guidance\n\nAPIs **may** support Batch Create using the following pattern:\n\n```proto\nrpc BatchCreateBooks(BatchCreateBooksRequest) returns (BatchCreateBooksResponse) {\n  option (google.api.http) = {\n    post: \"/v1/{parent=publishers/*}/books:batchCreate\"\n    body: \"*\"\n  };\n}\n```\n\n- The RPC's name **must** begin with `BatchCreate`. The remainder of the RPC\n  name **should** be the plural form of the resource being created.\n- The request and response messages **must** match the RPC name, with\n  `Request` and `Response` suffixes.\n  - However, in the event that the request may take a significant amount of\n    time, the response message **must** be a `google.longrunning.Operation`\n    which ultimately resolves to the `Response` type.\n- The HTTP verb **must** be `POST`.\n- The HTTP URI **must** end with `:batchCreate`.\n- The URI path **should** represent the collection for the resource, matching\n  the collection used for simple CRUD operations. If the operation spans\n  parents, a dash (`-`) **may** be accepted as a wildcard.\n- The body clause in the `google.api.http` annotation **should** be `\"*\"`.\n- The operation **should** be atomic: it **should** fail for all resources or\n  succeed for all resources (no partial success).\n  - If the operation covers multiple locations and at least one location is\n    down, the operation **must** fail.\n  - In cases where supporting partial responses cannot be avoided, the design\n    should follow the guidelines of [AIP-193](https://aip.dev/193).\n\n### Request message\n\nThe request for a batch create method **should** be specified with the\nfollowing pattern:\n\n```proto\nmessage BatchCreateBooksRequest {\n  // The parent resource shared by all books being created.\n  // Format: publishers/{publisher}\n  // If this is set, the parent field in the CreateBookRequest messages\n  // must either be empty or match this field.\n  string parent = 1 [\n    (google.api.resource_reference) = {\n      child_type: \"library.googleapis.com/Book\"\n    }];\n\n  // The request message specifying the resources to create.\n  // A maximum of 1000 books can be created in a batch.\n  repeated CreateBookRequest requests = 2\n    [(google.api.field_behavior) = REQUIRED];\n}\n```\n\n- A `parent` field **should** be included, unless the resource being created is\n  a top-level resource. If a caller sets this field, and the\n  `parent` field of any child request message does not match, the request\n  **must** fail. The `parent` field of child request messages can be omitted if\n  the `parent` field in this request is set.\n  - This field **should** be required if only 1 parent per request is allowed.\n  - The field **should** identify the [resource type][aip-122-parent] that it\n    references.\n  - The comment for the field **should** document the resource pattern.\n- The request message **must** include a repeated field which accepts the\n  request messages specifying the resources to create, as specified for\n  [standard Create methods][request-message]. The field **should** be named\n  `requests`.\n  - The field **should** be required.\n- Other fields **may** be \"hoisted\" from the [standard Create\n  request][request-message], which means that the field can be set at either\n  the batch level or child request level. Similar to `parent`, if both the\n  batch level and child request level are set for the same field, the values\n  **must** match.\n  - Fields which must be unique cannot be hoisted (e.g. Customer-provided id\n    fields).\n- The request message **must not** contain any other required fields, and\n  **should not** contain other optional fields except those described in this\n  or another AIP.\n- The comment above the `requests` field **should** document the maximum number\n  of requests allowed.\n\n### Response message\n\nThe response for a batch create method **should** be specified with the\nfollowing pattern:\n\n```proto\nmessage BatchCreateBooksResponse {\n  // Books created.\n  repeated Book books = 1;\n}\n```\n\n- The response message **must** include one repeated field corresponding to the\n  resources that were created.\n\n[aip-122-parent]: ./0122.md#fields-representing-a-resources-parent\n[request-message]: ./0133.md#request-message\n\n## Changelog\n\n- **2023-04-18**: Changed the recommendation to allow returning partial \n  successes.\n- **2022-06-02**: Changed suffix descriptions to eliminate superfluous \"-\".\n- **2020-09-16**: Suggested annotating `parent` and `requests` fields.\n- **2020-08-27**: Removed parent recommendations for top-level resources.\n- **2019-08-01**: Changed the examples from \"shelves\" to \"publishers\", to\n  present a better example of resource ownership.\n"}
