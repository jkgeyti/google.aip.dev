For the context of APIs, the following planes are\ndefined:\n\n- Management plane: a uniform, resource-oriented API that primarily\n  configures and allows retrieval of resources.\n- Data plane: a heterogenous API (ideally resource-oriented) that reads and\n  write user data. Often connects to entities provisioned by the management\n  plane, such as virtual machines.\n\nThe term \"plane\" was originally used in networking architecture. Although system\nand network architecture often defines additional planes (e.g. control plane or\npower planes), as the AIPs are focused on the interface, they are not defined in\nthis AIP.\n\n## Guidance\n\n### Management Plane\n\nManagement resources and methods exist primarily to provision, configure, and\naudit the resources that the data plane interfaces with.\n\nAs an example, the following are considered management resources for a cloud\nprovider:\n\n- virtual machines\n- virtual private networks\n- virtual disks\n- a blob store instance\n- a project or account\n\n### Data Plane\n\nMethods on the data plane operate on user data in a variety of data formats, and\ngenerally interface with a resource provisioned via a management plane API.\nExamples of data plane methods include:\n\n- writing and reading rows in a table\n- pushing to or pulling from a message queue\n- uploading blobs to or downloading blobs from a blob store instance\n\nData plane APIs **may** be heterogenous across a larger API surface, due to\nrequirements including high throughput, low latency, or the need to adhere to an\nexisting interface specification (e.g. ANSI SQL).\n\n- For convenience, resources and methods that operate on the data plane **may**\nexpose themselves via resource-oriented management APIs. If so, those resources\nand methods **must** adhere to the requirements of the management plane as\nspecified in the other AIPs ([AIP-131][] through [AIP-135][]).\n\n### Major distinctions between management and data plane\n\n- [Declarative clients][] operate on the management plane exclusively.\n- Data planes are often on the critical path of user-facing functionality, and\n  therefore:\n  - Have higher availabilty requirements than management planes.\n  - Are more peformance-sensitive than management planes.\n  - Require higher-throughput than management planes.\n\n\n[AIP-131]: ./0131.md\n[AIP-135]: ./0136.md\n[Declarative clients]: ./0009.md#declarative-clients\n\n## Changelog\n\n- **2023-06-10**: Introduction of this AIP."}
