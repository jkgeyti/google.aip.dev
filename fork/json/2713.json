However, it is surrounded by\nsome complicated issues.\n\nWe will consider making shared types for classes that are useful across\nmultiple Apps APIs, we just will not do it lightly. If you feel you have a case\nfor this, please contact us at apps-api-reviewers@google.com.\n\n## Guidance\n\nEach API owns its own types.\n\nIf your API needs to reference another API's objects, your API **must** contain\na reference ([resource name][aip-122] or ID) that can be used to get the\ninformation from that other API. For example, if your API wants to reference a\nrelevant Gmail message, you **must** store a Gmail message name, and the\nmessage itself will be accessed via the Gmail API, passing in that name. Your\nAPI **must not** contain an actual Gmail message object.\n\nFor smaller types, it is also reasonable to make a copy of the class.\n\n[aip-122]: ../0122.md\n[aip-213]: ../0213.md\n"}
