For example, a Sheets cell\nmay want to refer to the Slides deck that explains its meaning. This kind of\ncross reference should be as natural to use as possible with the target API.\n\n## Guidance\n\nWhen your API refers to an object accessed via another API (the \"target\" API),\nthe reference your API provides depends upon whether the reference is compliant\nwith One Platform or not.\n\n- If a field always holds a compliant reference to a single specific target\n  API, the reference you provide **must** be a relative URI from the top level\n  of the target API's naming hierarchy. For example, if the full URL of the\n  object is `https://koalas.googleapis.com/koalas/123435` the reference you\n  return to it **must** be the relative URI `koalas/123435`. Further, your\n  documentation must make clear that the reference is used with\n  `koalas.googleapis.com`.\n\n  This provides the developer with a natural way to use the reference, using\n  the returned path directly. It also ensures that they know which API\n  understands that reference.\n\n- If a field always holds a compliant reference, but is not limited to a single\n  target API, the reference you provide **must** be a relative URI that\n  includes the path of its specific target API, such as\n  `koalas.googleapis.com/koalas/123435`. This provides the developer with the\n  correct target in a formalized, usable way.\n\n- Otherwise, the reference you return **must** be chosen to be as natural to\n  use as possible with the target API, and the API and its version must be\n  documented. For example, if the Apiary-based Koala API uses an ID in its\n  `GetKoalaData` method, you **must** return the ID that can be used as a\n  parameter, as well as documenting that you are using IDs that work in Koala\n  API 1.0.\n\n### Naming\n\nFor compliant references, you **should** avoid the use of the terms \"reference\"\nand \"name\" in the field name. That is, `koala` is preferred to\n`koala_reference` or `koala_name`\n([see AIP-122](../0122.md#fields-representing-another-resource)).\n\nFor other target APIs, you **should** echo that API's terminology in the name\nfor clarity. For example, if the target API's `GetKoalaDataRequest` has a\n`koala_num` field, your field name **should** probably be `koala_num`, or it\nwould include `koala_num` in its name, such as `responsible_koala_num`.\n"}
